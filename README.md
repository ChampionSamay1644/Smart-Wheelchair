## 🎯 About The Project

The **AI-Powered Smart Wheelchair** is an innovative assistive technology designed to **redefine mobility and care** for individuals with physical impairments.  

Unlike traditional wheelchairs, this project transforms the device into an **intelligent companion** that emphasizes **safety, health monitoring, and independence**.

Our vision is to create a wheelchair that does more than move — it **cares, protects, and empowers**.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Objectives

We aim to design a **cost-effective, multifunctional smart wheelchair** that reduces dependency on caregivers while creating a **safer and more connected experience**.

### ✅ Key Objectives
- **Enhance Safety** → Intelligent automated collision-avoidance system.  
- **Promote Independence** → Hands-free AI-powered voice navigation.  
- **Enable Proactive Health Management** → Real-time vitals monitoring + emergency alerts.  
- **Reduce Medication Errors** → Automated pill dispenser with reminders.  
- **Improve Sustainability** → Hybrid energy (solar + kinetic) for extended range.

## ✨ Core Features (In Development)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎤 **AI Voice Control** | Hands-free navigation (e.g., *“Go forward”*, *“Stop”*). Perfect for users with limited upper-body mobility. |
| 🛑 **Collision Avoidance** | Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles. System auto-brakes to prevent accidents. |
| ❤️ **Health Monitoring** | Tracks **pulse & body temperature** in real-time and displays data on a screen. |
| 📧 **Emergency SMS Alerts** | Sends vital stats + alert to caregivers if abnormal readings are detected. |
| ☀️ **Dual Energy System** | Solar panel (doubles as sunshade) + hub dynamo trickle-charge the battery. |
| 🕹️ **Joystick Override** | Manual control for precision or when voice is unsuitable. |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned)

- **Primary Controller** → Raspberry Pi (AI, voice, decision-making)  
- **Real-time Controller** → ESP32 (sensors, motors, real-time tasks)  
- **Software** → Python (high-level control), C++/Arduino (low-level management)  
- **Sensors** → Ultrasonic, MAX30102 (pulse), DS18B20 (temperature)  
- **Communication** → SIM800L GSM module (SMS alerts)
