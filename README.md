## 🎯 About The Project

The **AI-Powered Smart Wheelchair** is an innovative assistive technology designed to **redefine mobility and care** for individuals with physical impairments.  

Unlike traditional wheelchairs, this project transforms the device into an **intelligent companion** that emphasizes **safety, health monitoring, and independence**.

Our vision is to create a wheelchair that does more than move — it **cares, protects, and empowers**.

## 🚀 Vision & Objectives

We aim to design a **cost-effective, multifunctional smart wheelchair** that reduces dependency on caregivers while creating a **safer and more connected experience**.

### ✅ Key Objectives
- **Enhance Safety** → Intelligent automated collision-avoidance system.  
- **Promote Independence** → Hands-free AI-powered voice navigation.  
- **Enable Proactive Health Management** → Real-time vitals monitoring + emergency alerts.  
- **Reduce Medication Errors** → Automated pill dispenser with reminders.  
- **Improve Sustainability** → Hybrid energy (solar + kinetic) for extended range.

## ✨ Core Features (In Development)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎤 **Multilingual Speech-to-Text** | Converts spoken commands from users into text in multiple languages to ensure accessibility. |
| 🎙️ **Voice Command Recognition** | Detects and identifies voice commands to control wheelchair navigation hands-free. |
| 🛑 **Collision Avoidance** | Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and automatically stop or reroute to prevent accidents. |
| ❤️ **Health Monitoring** |Continuously tracks **pulse rate and body temperature**, showing real-time health data on an onboard screen. |
| 📧 **Emergency SMS Alerts** | Sends real-time health data and location alerts to caregivers or family during abnormal readings or emergencies. |
| ☀️ **Dual Energy System** | Combines a solar panel (which also serves as a sunshade) with a hub dynamo to sustainably charge the battery. |
| 🕹️ **Multimodal controls** | Offers alternative input modes—such as voice, application input, or joystick for users who cannot rely solely on voice. |
